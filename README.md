# PyTorch Production

A pre-configured and fully integrated software stack with PyTorch, an open source software library for machine learning, and the Python programming language. It provides a stable and tested execution environment for training, inference, or running as an API service. The stack is designed for short and long-running high-performance tasks, and can be easily integrated into continuous integration and deployment workflows.

The stack is built in several variations with different hardware optimization features: OpenBLAS and Intel MKL for x86 CPU, and CUDA for NVidia GPU.
